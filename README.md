# PoetryDB

## Introduction

PoetryDB is an API for internet poets. <i>But what is an API? </i>

An API ensures that a program (such as a browser) always returns data in an expected format. <i>JSON</i> is one of the most popular formats in use today.

"Why should poets care?" [The answer](http://thecombedthunderclap.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/kenneth-goldsmith-and-uncreative-writing.html) is blowing in the data winds. Internet technology is making words endlessly manipulable, and traditional poets and writers are getting left behind. I want to change this, by giving us all a leg up into a more empowered future.

<i>How does it work?</i>

You send a URL like [so](http://poetrydb.org/title/Ozymandias/lines.json):

```
http://poetrydb.org/title/Ozymandias/lines.json
```

And hey, presto! out comes the lines of Shelley's famous sonnet:

```
[
  {
    "lines": [
      "I met a traveller from an antique land",
      "Who said: \"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone",
      "Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,",
      "Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown",
      "And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command",
      "Tell that its sculptor well those passions read",
      "Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,",
      "The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.",
      "And on the pedestal these words appear:",
      "'My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:",
      "Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!'",
      "Nothing beside remains. Round the decay",
      "Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,",
      "The lone and level sands stretch far away\"."
    ]
  }
]
```

But what do we do with text in json format? The real power of PoetryDB's API becomes apparent when combined with a program. Consider the following Ruby code:

```
require 'httparty'

response = HTTParty.get("http://poetrydb.org/author,linecount/Shakespeare;14/lines").to_a
(0..13).each { |i| puts response[rand(154)]['lines'][i] }
```

This fairly simple code is capable of surprising poetry! The program asks PoetryDB for all poems that are 14 lines in length, then writes out a new sonnet based on the results. Astute readers will know that this is the first step towards creating your own version of Raymond Queneau's [One Hundred Thousand Billion Sonnets](http://www.growndodo.com/wordplay/oulipo/10%5E14sonnets.html), this time based on some of the most beautiful lines ever written in the English language.

Here is an example:

```
Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;
Full character'd with lasting memory,
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
For that sweet odour, which doth in it live.
Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold,
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
But the defendant doth that plea deny,
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
  Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,
  Compar'd with loss of thee, will not seem so.
```

## Architecture and code

The API is written in Ruby and uses Sinatra to resolve API routes. The poetry data is stored in a MongoDB database. The Ruby code is provided here as Open Source. The PoetryDB database is not directly accessible, in order to preserve its integrity.

## API Reference

<b>General format of API:</b>

```
/<input field>/<search term>[;<search term>][..][:<search type>][/<output field>][,<output field>][..][.<format>]
```

* ```<input field>``` can be one of:

  ```author```: The name, or part of the name, of the author of a poem  
  ```title```: The title, or part of the title, of a poem  
  ```lines```: Part of a line or lines of a poem  
  ```linecount```: The number of lines of a poem, including section headings, but excluding empty lines (eg. section breaks)  

* ```<search term>``` relates to ```<input field>```. When ```<input field>``` is:

  ```author```: ```<field data>``` is the name, or part of the name, of the author of a poem  
  ```title```: ```<field data>``` is the title, or part of the title, of a poem  
  ```lines```: ```<field data>``` is part of a line or lines of a poem  
  ```linecount```: ```<field data>``` is the number of lines of a poem (use with ```:abs``` to avoid fuzzy search, eg. "14" also implies "114"). Number of lines includes section headings, but excludes empty lines (eg. section breaks)

* ```[:<search type>]``` is optional. It can be:

  ```:abs```: Match ```<search term>``` exactly when searching ```<input field>```  
  ```Default (empty)```: match ```<search term>``` with any part of ```<input field>``` when searching  
  
* ```[/<output field>][,<output field>][..]``` are optional. They are a comma delimited set that can be any combination of:  
  
  ```author```: Return only the author of each of the matching poems  
  ```title```: Return only the title of each of the matching poems  
  ```lines```: Return only the lines of each of the matching poems  
  ```linecount```: Return only the number of lines of each of the matching poems  
  ```author,title,...```: Return each output field in the comma delimited list of each of the matching poems  
  ```Default (empty)```: Return all data of each of the matching poems  
  
  or:  
  
  ```all```: Return all data of the matching poems (same as ```Default (empty)```)  
  
* ```[.<format>]``` is optional. It can be:  
  
  ```.json```: Return data in json format  
  ```.text```: Return data in text format  
  ```Default (empty)```: Return data in json format  

* ```[..]``` means that by using the same syntax, more instances of the preceding type can be expressed

lines
I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown
And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.
And on the pedestal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!'
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,
The lone and level sands stretch far away".

### Combinations

<b>General Format:</b>
```
/<input field>,<input field>[,<input field>][..]/<search term>;<search term>[;<search term][..][:abs][/<output field>][,<output field>][..][.<format>]
```

Notes: 
1. The number of input fields should always be matched by the number of search terms
2. The search terms are separated by the semicolon to allow commas to be used in search terms. However, semicolons are a feature of many texts, and unfortunately cannot be part of the search term currently.

Format:
```
/<input field>,<input field>,<input field>/<search term>;<search term>;<search term>

Example:
```
/title,author,linecount/Winter;Shakespeare;18

Result:
```
